Salt Lake lies in a mountain valley with the Wasatch Mountains to the east and north, and the Oquirrh (pronounced “oaker”) Mountains to the west. State Street runs north to south at the bottom of the valley floor. The area was once covered by the ancient Lake Bonneville. This huge lake once stretched across Utah, Nevada, and Idaho. The eastern parts of the city were built on ancient beaches of this lake and are now called, “benches” in the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains. The Great Salt Lake is the last remaining remnant of Lake Bonneville. Its shores form the northwest border of Salt Lake.
