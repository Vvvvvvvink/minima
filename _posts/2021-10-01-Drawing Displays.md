**[Site Analysis]**

Salt Lake is the largest metropolitan area in Utah. Salt Lake is used to refer to both the city and the county. The city is bordered by the Great Salt Lake and the snow-capped Wasatch Range. Meanwhile, the county stretches from the suburbs of North Salt Lake to Bluffdale and is ringed by the Oquirrh (pronounced “oaker”) and Wasatch ranges.

Commercial / Industrial / Educational / Residential.

On average, for the areas studied, vegetation covers about 46% of the area (ranging 44–51%), roofs cover about 21% (ranging 15–24%), and paved surfaces about 26% (ranging 21–28%). For the most part, trees shade streets, parking lots, grass, and sidewalks. In most non-residential areas, paved surfaces cover 46–66% of the area. In residential areas, on average, paved surfaces cover about 32% of the area.

Urban housing faces the practical problems of high housing prices and limited space. At the same time, housing still needs to satisfy the demand for “home” for residents. Comfort and sense of belonging are people’s basic requirements for “home”. The home is a refuge, but also a storage space. On the basis of meeting the needs of life, “home” brings more spiritual comfort to people. For people of different ages, people’s needs for functional space are different, and it will change. Therefore, “home” should be changing, not constant. As residents have different needs for functions, the “home” should be able to adapt to changes. In addition, the changing “home” will bring more interest and experience to the residents. Taking Salt Lake City as a location, housing needs to adapt to many situations. Modular building units can be flexibly changed according to different terrain requirements. No matter from the perspective of “home” or the city, housing should show modularity and variability. The garbage management in Salt Lake City is improving day by day, and the garbage is recycled and used as building materials to create circular buildings. The form and materials of the building will not be constant, because they are often taken locally and modified.

**[Concept]**

Never Constant —- Recycling, keep changing.

Recycled materials can be transformed into any form after reprocessing, and the combination and use of different materials can form a new “home”.

Recyclable building, a “home” created in a garbage dump.
